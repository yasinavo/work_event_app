It assumes a Western\nworkweek, in which weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\n*Looking for a vanilla JS version of this library? Check out\n[bizniz.js](https://github.com/jmeas/bizniz.js)*\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Moment](http://momentjs.com/) is an indispensable tool for working with dates in Javascript, but it\ndoesn't supply methods for working with week days or weekend days (at least,\n[not yet](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1947)).\n\nThis library supplies you with those missing tools.\n\n### Why this library?\n\nThere are alternative libraries for these methods, but this one uses constant-time algorithms, not loops.\nLoops are easier for a human to write, but are much slower for a computer to resolve.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nInstall this library through npm.\n\n```js\nnpm install moment-business\n```\n\nNext, import it into your project.\n\n```js\nimport business from 'moment-business';\n\nbusiness.isWeekDay(someMoment);\n```\n\n*Note: this library is also available through Bower.*\n\n### API\n\n##### `weekDays( startMoment, endMoment )`\n\nCalculate the number of week days between `startMoment` and `endMoment`. Week days are Monday through Friday.\n\nIf `endMoment` comes before `startMoment`, then this function will return a negative value.\n\n##### `weekendDays( startMoment, endMoment )`\n\nCalculate the number of weekend days between the moment and `otherMoment`. Weekend days are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIf `endMoment` comes before `startMoment`, then this function will return a negative value.\n\n##### `addWeekDays( moment, amount )`\n\nAdd week days to a moment, modifying the original moment. Returns the moment.\n\n##### `subtractWeekDays( moment, amount )`\n\nSubtract week days from the moment, modifying the original moment. Returns the moment.\n\n##### `isWeekDay( moment )`\n\nWhether or not the Moment is a week day (Monday - Friday).\n\n##### `isWeekendDay( moment )`\n\nWhether or not the Moment occurs on Saturday or Sunday.\n",
